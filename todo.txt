Ask Tuomas - DONE
  - code documentation as in other course modules
  - test should be in src/test ?
  - Intention to use Swing for GUI as there are a lot more tutorials and documentation
    --- javax.swing vs scala.swing same? javax.swing allowed?

Familiarize GUI library (java swing) - DONE
  - dummy triangles for understanding coordinate system
  - dummy hexagon from triangles

Implement the game engine (backend) for a simple functional program
  - convert TriGridPos to CartersianGridPos requires double, how to deal in Grid system - DONE
  - study O1 GUI to see how size of components are handled - Done
    => Use coordinate that is relative to the user's screen (TrianglesPanel for example)

  - Redesign engine.grid system [TriGrid]
    + Idea: hashmap from (a,b,c) to (x,y) in TriGrid, with rows and columns same with the hexagon
    (e.g., row 1 and 4 have 5 tiles, row 2 and 4 have 7 tiles)
    + `contains` method follow the rule above
    + IMPORTANT: follow O1's RobotWorld implementation: Pos, Board consists of TriHolder, TriTile are
      removable pieces that the player interacts with

  - Add variable `holder` to TriTile

  - Add exchange method to GameBoard and TilesHolder to exchange TriTile

  - TriGridPos: separate the position in coordinate system - DONE
    vs the triangle itself (e.g., TriGridPos should be immutable, and edgeLength should
    belong to the triangle, not the position from logical perspective)
    => Solution: keep the edgeLength variable, update it with the width of the panel for
    the TriArea

  - Shifting methods to shift GameBoard and TileHolder origin (coordinate shifting)
    and their TriTiles in GUI

Implement the file handling functions (read + write)
