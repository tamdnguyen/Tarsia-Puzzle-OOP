Ask Tuomas - DONE
  - code documentation as in other course modules
  - test should be in src/test ?
  - Intention to use Swing for GUI as there are a lot more tutorials and documentation
    --- javax.swing vs scala.swing same? javax.swing allowed?

Familiarize GUI library (java swing) - DONE
  - dummy triangles for understanding coordinate system
  - dummy hexagon from triangles

Implement the game engine 
  - convert TriGridPos to CartersianGridPos requires double, how to deal in Grid system - DONE
  - study O1 GUI to see how size of components are handled - DONE
  - TriGridPos: separate the position in coordinate system vs the triangle itself - DONE
  - Redesign engine.grid system [TriGrid] - DONE
  - addTile(tile, pos) and initializeTile(pos) in Board - DONE
  - Add exchange method to GameBoard and TilesHolder to exchange engine.TriTile - DONE
  - Finish TriTile: very close - DONE
  - be able to draw TriHolder with dashed-line in GUI - DONE
  - Check equal TriTile: all edge values are the same - DONE
  - Check neighbors() when meet the edge cases - DONE
  - neighbor() GridPos - DONE
  - Usage of updateCoords() when exchangeTile() - DONE
  - Break down generateSolution() into smaller functions - DONE
  - Bug in GameBoard because of allMatchingEdges hasIdenticalTiles inf loop - DONE
  - require that all edges in GameBoard > 0 after generateSolution - DONE
  - Check if the program always generate new TriTile and TriHolder and not same object - DONE


  - check for last comment in git commit
  - method to pick TriTile
  - method to copy/clone the objects in the game
  - Record shuffle moves

  - Shifting methods to shift GameBoard and TileHolder origin (coordinate shifting)
    and their TriTiles in GUI

Implement testing - DONE

Implement the file handling functions (read + write)
